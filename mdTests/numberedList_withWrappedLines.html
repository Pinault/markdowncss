<li>This list element is the first list element of many which will surely come.</li>
<li>This list element is the second list element, and probably my favorite out
of all of them.</li>
<li>This list element is the third list element, which means it probably is
anxious and has to fill niches not filled by the other two.</li>
<li>The fourth list element is lazy.
<ol>
<li>First nested numerberd lists shows <em>emphasis</em>.
<ol>
<li>The element shown as <em>4.1.a</em> was written as <code>_4.1.a_</code>.</li>
<li>The element shown as <em>4.1.b</em> was written as <code>*4.1.b*</code>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Second nested numerberd lists shows <strong>bold</strong>.
<ol>
<li>The element shown as <strong>4.2.a</strong> was written as <code>__4.2.a__</code>.</li>
<li>The element shown as <strong>4.2.b</strong> was written as <code>**4.2.b**</code>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Third nested numerberd lists shows interchangeability of underscored and star characters
<ol>
<li>The element shown as <em><em>4.3.a</em></em> was written as <code>_*4.3.a*_</code>.</li>
<li>The element shown as <em><em>4.3.b</em></em> was written as <code>*_4.3.b_*</code>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Fourth nested numerberd lists shows interchangeability of underscored and star characters
<ol>
<li>The element shown as <em><strong>4.4.a</strong></em> was written as <code>_**4.4.a**_</code>.</li>
<li>The element shown as <strong><em>4.4.b</em></strong> was written as <code>**_4.4.b_**</code>.</li>
<li>The element shown as <strong><em>4.4.c</em></strong> was written as <code>__*4.4.c*__</code>.</li>
<li>The element shown as <em><strong>4.4.d</strong></em> was written as <code>*__4.4.d__*</code>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Fifth nested numerberd lists tests further unknown/undefined behaviour
<ol>
<li>The element shown as <em><em></em>4.5.a<em></em></em> was written as <code>_*_4.5.a_*_</code>.</li>
<li>The element shown as <em><em></em>4.5.b<em></em></em> was written as <code>*_*4.5.b*_*</code>.</li>
