1. This list element is the first list element of many which will surely come.
1. This list element is the second list element, and probably my favorite out
   of all of them.
1. This list element is the third list element, which means it probably is
   anxious and has to fill niches not filled by the other two.
1. The fourth list element is lazy.
	2. First nested numerberd lists shows _emphasis_.
		3. The element shown as _4.1.a_ was written as `_4.1.a_`.
		3. The element shown as *4.1.b* was written as `*4.1.b*`.
	2. Second nested numerberd lists shows **bold**.
		3. The element shown as __4.2.a__ was written as `__4.2.a__`.
		3. The element shown as **4.2.b** was written as `**4.2.b**`.
	2. Third nested numerberd lists shows interchangeability of underscored and star characters
		3. The element shown as _*4.3.a*_ was written as `_*4.3.a*_`.
		3. The element shown as *_4.3.b_* was written as `*_4.3.b_*`.
	2. Fourth nested numerberd lists shows interchangeability of underscored and star characters
		3. The element shown as _**4.4.a**_ was written as `_**4.4.a**_`.
		3. The element shown as **_4.4.b_** was written as `**_4.4.b_**`.
		3. The element shown as __*4.4.c*__ was written as `__*4.4.c*__`.
		3. The element shown as *__4.4.d__* was written as `*__4.4.d__*`.
	2. Fifth nested numerberd lists tests further unknown/undefined behaviour
		3. The element shown as _*_4.5.a_*_ was written as `_*_4.5.a_*_`.
		3. The element shown as *_*4.5.b*_* was written as `*_*4.5.b*_*`.
